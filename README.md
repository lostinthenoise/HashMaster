# HashMaster

I created a JavaFX app that generates SHA hashes with a GUI. Never used JavaFX before, so I wanted to give ita go. I used Scene Builder to design the interface and IntelliJ to write the code. I left just about everything in the project folder to make it easier to load in Scene Builder and IntelliJ.
